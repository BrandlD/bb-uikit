# BB-UIkit

bb-UIkit is a wrapper for the UIkit Framework. Only this wrapper is meant to work alongside your native WordPress Theme, rather than the basis for a new theme.

UIkit is not my work, more about UIkit can be found here:

This wrapper was designed for Beaver Builder Theme, but might also work with other themes.

**Note:**
Don't get yourself fooled by the size of this plugin. The current plugin has all the less-styling and the pre-packed AlekVolsk extension for extra columns in the subfolders. The actual enqueued js and css files are somewhere around 800 kb, the size of 2 large images, but will allow you to do amazing stuff.
